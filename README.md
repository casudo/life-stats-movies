  <h1>Excel x IMDb</h1>
  This project is a used to display various statistics regarding watched movies in real life. If the user tracks when and how often they watched a movie in an Excel sheet, this tool can enrich the data with information from the IMDb API like ratings, genres, cast, and more and display it in a GUI for "interesting" visualization.
