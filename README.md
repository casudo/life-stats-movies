## Prerequisites

You need to be a movie nerd who tracks their watched movies in an Excel sheet... if you haven't passed out from boredom yet, this tool might be for you.

If you keep track of the movies you've watched in this fashion..

| Title           | Last Seen  | Rating | Notes         |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------ | ------------- |
| Inception       | 2025-03-19 | 9/10   | Mind-blowing  |
| Matrix Reloaded | 2025-07-15 | 6/10   | Part 2        |
| The Old Guard 2 | 2025-08-10 | 3/10   | Waste of time |

..you can use this tool to enrich your data with IMDb information such as release years, actors, genres, and ratings. You can then use this enriched data to visualize your movie-watching habits in interesting ways.
